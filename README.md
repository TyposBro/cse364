# PART II

#### Person API

CRUD operations for `/person` api

#### Blob API

Binary UPLOAD and DELETE operations for `/blob` api

#### Record API

CRUD operations for `/record` api

## complete documentation on each api and required/optional params can be found [here](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui)

# PART III

There are 10 test cases for `/record` and `/rerson` APIs,
since blob api containts simple operations on binary, we thought it's not nececarry
to implement Unit tests.
